# SWING_BASICS
7 small applications using Swing 
These little applications show a thing or two about how to work with Swing. Layout and Threadding are the main focus.
#1 innerclass
Shows the main thread, the GUI thread and the EventDispatch Queue in action. While the main thread is
opening, closing and reopening the window you can type into the TextField and reverse the text by clicking the button.
#2 invoker
This shows how to control behaviour from a non-GUI class and send it to the Event Dispatch Queue for execution while full
GUI responsiveness is maintained.
#3 login
Just fiddles a bit with the layout to show which properties to set where.
#4 menubar 
This shows how to implement the Swing menu bar.
#5 observer
This code is making use of the underlying document or ComponentUI by tracking the change to the document of the TextField.
#6 sudoku
Uses the sudoku matrix as an example and shows things like LookandFeel, on screen positioning, packing vs. sizing and the like.
#7 swingworker
Shows how to use the the SwingWorker class. Doing GUI-independent tasks and writing the intermediate results back to the GUI.s
